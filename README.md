# Object detection and data transmission

The goal of this notebook is to implement a program, which can transmit some data over bluetooth to another device. I came up with the idea of combining this transmission with an object detection application. In other words, I implemented a Python program to detect objects shown to the camera and transmit the label via bluetooth to another laptop, using MediaPipe and Socket libraries in Python respectively. In this case, I considered a tripod and a pair of sunglasses as the objects our imaginary robot is looking for. I used MobileNetV2 architecture and imagenet dataset, which contains a great number of different objects, to train the model.
